## CSV Import Guide

### Overview

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) import allows you to bulk-import transactions from other financial tools, bank statements, or spreadsheets.

### CSV Format Specification

FinSmart accepts CSV files with the following structure:

#### Required Columns

| Column | Format | Description | Example |
|--------|--------|-------------|---------|
| `date` | YYYY-MM-DD | Transaction date | `2025-01-15` |
| `amount` | Decimal | Transaction amount (positive) | `45.50` |
| `direction` | IN/OUT | Money direction | `OUT` |
| `description` | Text | Transaction description | `Grocery shopping` |
| `account_name` | Text | Account name (must exist) | `Main Checking` |

#### Optional Columns

| Column | Format | Description | Example |
|--------|--------|-------------|---------|
| `category_name` | Text | Category name (must exist) | `Groceries` |
| `merchant` | Text | Merchant name | `Tesco` |
| `notes` | Text | Additional notes | `Weekly shopping` |

### Example CSV File

```csv
date,amount,direction,description,account_name,category_name,merchant,notes
2025-01-15,45.50,OUT,Grocery shopping,Main Checking,Groceries,Tesco,Weekly shopping
2025-01-16,75.00,OUT,Gas station,Main Checking,Transportation,Shell,Filled up tank

2025-01-20,150.00,OUT,Electric bill,Main Checking,Utilities,British Gas,Monthly payment
```

### CSV Format Rules

1. **Header Row**: Must be present with exact column names (case-sensitive)
2. **Encoding**: UTF-8 (recommended) or ASCII
3. **Delimiter**: Comma (`,`)
4. **Quotes**: Use double quotes (`"`) for fields containing commas
5. **Date Format**: ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
6. **Amount Format**: 
   - Decimal number with up to 2 decimal places
   - Use period (`.`) as decimal separator
   - No currency symbols or commas
7. **Direction Values**: Exactly `IN` or `OUT` (case-sensitive)
8. **Empty Fields**: Optional fields can be empty but must have column

### Preparing Your CSV File

#### From Excel or Google Sheets

1. Organize data with correct column headers
2. Format dates as YYYY-MM-DD (use formula: `=TEXT(A2,"YYYY-MM-DD")`)
3. Format amounts as numbers (remove currency formatting)
4. Save as/Export to CSV format:
   - Excel: File → Save As → CSV (Comma delimited)
   - Google Sheets: File → Download → Comma-separated values

#### From Bank Export

Many banks provide CSV exports. You may need to:

1. **Map columns**: Rename bank columns to match FinSmart format
2. **Convert dates**: Transform bank date format to YYYY-MM-DD
3. **Convert amounts**: Remove currency symbols, format as decimal
4. **Add direction**: Add `direction` column based on debit/credit
5. **Add account_name**: Add column with your account name

**Example Mapping:**

| Bank Column | FinSmart Column | Transformation |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Transaction Date | date | Reformat to YYYY-MM-DD |
| Description | description | Direct copy |
| Debit | amount + direction | Amount → amount, "DR" → OUT |
| Credit | amount + direction | Amount → amount, "CR" → IN |
| Balance | (ignore) | Not needed |

### Importing CSV Files

**⚠️ Note:** CSV import UI is not yet implemented in the frontend. Use API endpoint directly or implement the feature.

#### Using API Endpoint (Advanced Users)

If you're comfortable with command-line tools:

```bash
# Create a transaction via API for each CSV row
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "accountId": "account-uuid-here",
    "postedAt": "2025-01-15T00:00:00Z",
    "amount": 45.50,
    "direction": "OUT",
    "description": "Grocery shopping",
    "categoryId": "category-uuid-here",
    "merchant": "Tesco",
    "notes": "Weekly shopping"
  }'
```

#### Manual Import Alternative

For smaller datasets, manually create transactions:
1. Navigate to Transactions page
2. Click "Add Transaction" for each CSV row
3. Copy data from CSV to form fields

### CSV Import Best Practices

1. **Validate Data First**:
   - Check dates are in correct format
   - Verify amounts are positive numbers
   - Ensure accounts and categories exist in system

2. **Create Accounts & Categories First**:
   - Add all necessary accounts before import
   - Create all categories referenced in CSV

3. **Backup Before Import**:
   - Export existing transactions (if possible)
   - Test with small CSV file first (5-10 rows)

4. **Handle Duplicates**:
   - FinSmart doesn't auto-detect duplicates
   - Check for existing transactions before import
   - Use date + amount + description to identify duplicates

5. **Split Large Files**:
   - Import in batches of 100-500 transactions
   - Easier to troubleshoot errors
   - Reduces memory usage

### CSV Import Errors & Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Invalid date format | Date not in YYYY-MM-DD | Reformat dates in Excel: `=TEXT(A2,"YYYY-MM-DD")` |
| Account not found | account_name doesn't exist | Create account first or fix name spelling |
| Category not found | category_name doesn't exist | Create category first or remove category column |
| Invalid direction | Not "IN" or "OUT" | Change to exactly `IN` or `OUT` (case-sensitive) |
| Invalid amount | Negative or non-numeric | Ensure positive number with max 2 decimals |
| Missing required field | Empty date, amount, etc. | Fill in all required columns |

## Tips & Best Practices

### Getting Started Right

1. **Create Your Accounts First**:
   - Add all bank accounts, credit cards, savings
   - Use consistent naming (e.g., "Chase Checking" not "checking")

2. **Set Up Categories**:
   - Review default categories
   - Add any custom categories you need
   - Use distinct colors for easy identification

3. **Start with Current Month**:
   - Begin tracking from today forward
   - Optionally import last 1-3 months of history
   - Don't try to import years of data at once

### Transaction Management

1. **Regular Entry**:
   - Enter transactions weekly (or more frequently)
   - Don't let backlog build up
   - Review bank statements to catch missed items

2. **Categorization**:
   - Categorize every transaction
   - Use consistent categories
   - Review uncategorized transactions monthly

3. **Add Details**:
   - Use merchant field for better tracking
   - Add notes for unusual transactions
   - Include reference numbers for important transactions

### Budget Management

1. **Start Conservative**:
   - Set realistic budgets based on past spending
   - Easier to loosen than tighten budgets
   - Adjust monthly based on actual spending

2. **Monitor Progress**:
   - Check budget summary weekly
   - Look for yellow/red progress bars
   - Adjust spending if approaching limit

3. **Budget Categories**:
   - Focus on variable expenses (groceries, dining)
   - Don't budget fixed expenses (rent) - track separately
   - Budget "fun money" to avoid burnout

### Using Insights Effectively

1. **Monthly Review Routine**:
   - Generate insights on the 1st of each month
   - Review anomalies and investigate unusual transactions
   - Compare actual vs. forecast from previous month

2. **Forecast Planning**:
   - Use forecasts to plan next month's budget
   - Adjust for known upcoming expenses
   - Save forecasts in PDF reports for tracking

3. **Anomaly Investigation**:
   - High Z-scores (>2.5) warrant investigation
   - Check for duplicate entries
   - Verify large one-time purchases
   - Update categories if needed

### Data Quality

1. **Consistent Naming**:
   - Use same merchant names (e.g., always "Shell" not "Shell Gas")
   - Standardize account names
   - Use title case for descriptions

2. **Accurate Dates**:
   - Use transaction post date (not authorization date)
   - Be consistent with timing
   - Align with bank statement dates

3. **Regular Audits**:
   - Monthly: Review all transactions for accuracy
   - Quarterly: Reconcile with bank statements
   - Yearly: Archive/export data for records

### Security & Privacy

1. **Strong Passwords**:
   - Use unique password for FinSmart
   - Minimum 12 characters recommended
   - Consider using password manager

2. **Session Management**:
   - Log out when using shared computers
   - Session expires after 60 minutes of inactivity
   - Don't share your account credentials

3. **Data Privacy**:
   - Your data is stored securely in PostgreSQL
   - Passwords are hashed with BCrypt
   - Audit logs track all data changes

### Performance Tips

1. **Large Transaction Lists**:
   - Use filters to narrow results
   - Pagination loads faster than full lists
   - Search by date range for older transactions

2. **PDF Reports**:
   - Generate reports only when needed
   - Reports are created on-demand (not cached)
   - Large datasets may take 5-10 seconds

3. **Browser Performance**:
   - Clear browser cache occasionally
   - Modern browsers work best
   - Disable unnecessary browser extensions
